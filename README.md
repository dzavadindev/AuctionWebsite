# Important notes

- For an artist, a term "author" is being used every where, and Im not sure of how logically correct that is. And I dont want to rename every instance of it in the whole project. In any way, it doesn't hurt the clarity.
- Styling of the Home.svelte page had seen better days. I was told to not bother with @medea queries, but its worth mentioning that the list of items doesn't always act as intended (such as weird stretches and cut-offs I have not figured out a solution for).
